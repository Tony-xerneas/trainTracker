# trainTracker

### The Train Tracker App

* In this assignment, we are tasked with creating a web app that allows users to see train arrivals to a destination, all the while being able to add a train system is they do not see a route they typically use.

* To best complete this assignment, it is great to look back on previous examples to get a good idea on a starting point.
